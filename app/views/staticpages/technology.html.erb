<h3>Your content</h3>
<h6>Take notes as you would normally, in fact generate your content in whichever way suits you.</h6>
<h3>Our information capturing system</h3>
<h6>Enter your content using our technology.  This is a similar concept to memory.  Where the information is not stored as in a library but scattered around the system and reconstituted when required.  This allows the human brain to make tremendous leaps forward.  Something a library would never do.</h6>
<h3>Living Documents</h3>
<h6>Our proprietary algorithm mimics the brain in recalling data and presenting it in the form you require at that time.  Unlike your memory it never forgets!</h6>

<div class="techright">
<h3>Secure Access</h3>
<h6>Your information is yours.  At Minerva we will never see your information.  The account creation process allows you to access a secure part of the site.</h6>
<h3>Create Communities</h3>
<h6>Share your notes with your colleagues, study friends or any network.  Leverage the network effect, and reach better conclusions.  This is socially sharing our brains for research!</h6>

<ul>
<li><%= image_tag 'male172.svg' %><h4>The technology stores information as you <b>brain</b> does.  The brain does not store memories in document form.  This brain will never forget and the memories will never degrade.</h4></li>
<li><%= image_tag 'marketing8.svg' %><h4>Tags act as a <b>mind map</b> showing linkages between items.  Shifting from node to node allows for greater understanding of the linkages between issues.</h4></li>
<li><%= image_tag 'menu2.svg' %><h4>The delivery technology acts like an <b>outliner</b>.  Putting your notes into an outline format allows a significant amount of information to be presented in the smallest possible size.</h4></li>
<li><%= image_tag 'network3.svg' %><h4>Building your own <b>'network'</b> of likeminded individuals allows the technology to act as a hive mind.  Merging with our technology gives you all of the brain power at Minerva as well</h4></li>
<li><%= image_tag 'note30.svg' %><h4>The <b>note taking</b> technology intuitively allows smart entry of notes.  The integration of this note taking technology with the all the other aspects is what makes it so powerful.</h4></li>
<li><%= image_tag 'right177.svg' %><h4><b>Content is separated from layout.</b>  This is the way content should live.  Not shackled to a layout until the layout has been decided upon.  By freeing content from its layout it is infinitely recyclable.</h4></li>
