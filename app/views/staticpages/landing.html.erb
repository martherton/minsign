				<li><h3>1. We Research</h3></li>

	   		<li><h4>Using our own technology we curate investment intelligence in areas of interest for investors. Our team of researchers and editors undertakes the difficult and time consuming ground work of researching information and finding the right sources of intelligence. We also continually monitor these sources to ensure the best possible quality of information at all times.</h4></li></br>

	   		<li><h4>You register for an account with Minerva and after your details are verified we create your secure profile. Once your account is ready, you will have access to the same smart tagging technology our research team uses and our bespoke research delivery algorithm. If your account includes access to our resarch you will have instant access to our professionally curated research content.</h4></li>

        <li><h4>The idea behind the information capture technology has been developed over the years we have apent as researchers ourselves. Likewise, the algorithm is the result of many years spent trying to improve the delivery and consumption of information. </h4></li>

Your information is only shared with those you wish to share it.  We have no access to the information you enter into our system.</h4></li>

        <li><h4>Information is truly separated from layout at Minerva.  Each information 'point' is seen as a node in a neural network of information points.  This allows the system to deliver information effectively and efficiently.  It also allows the system to identify links between information that may otherwise have been overlloked.</h4></li>
