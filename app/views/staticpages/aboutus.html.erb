      <h2>Minerva was founded by a team who have extensive experience in both investment research and decision making within the financial services industry. </h2><h2>Through the use of cutting edge technology, Minerva seeks to significantly reduce the time required to find factual, qualitative information.</h2>
      <h2>We recognise that using traditional search tools can result in the quest for public information being time consuming and frustrating.   Minerva ensures that facts are available in a rapid, resource-light way and delivered in an intuitive manner, allowing you to focus upon creating an opinion and making an informed investment decisions.  </h2>
      <h2>Minerva can be saved to your desktop and enables rapid access to public information, which is vital to your investment process</h2>
      <h2>With the initial launch including listing requirements and takeover regulations in all jurisdictions, we are starting off with a modest service.  We believe this allows us to build a service that truly meets the requirements of its clients.</h2>
      <h2>During the course of 2015 Minerva will develop into an indispensible 'briefing' service for professional investors.  </h2>
      <h2>If you have a specific briefing requirement or a need to collate hard to find resources please contact us. We invite you to join us on this journey and help us to shape and evolve the service.  </h2>
